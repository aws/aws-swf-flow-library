/**
 * Promise is a future like object that is used as a placeholder for a result of
 * an asynchronous API. Java Future is a synchronization construct that is used
 * to block a thread that called get() method if result is not available yet.
 * Promise differs from it as it cannot be used for blocking. A call to its
 * get() method throws IllegalStateException if result is not available yet. The
 * correct way to ensure that Promise is ready is to access it from a method
 * that is annotated as @Asynchronous and have the given Promise as one its
 * arguments or from {@link Task#doExecute()} method assuming that promise was
 * passed to the Task as a constructor parameter.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Promise is not linked to error handling like Future is. In case of exceptions
 * they are propagated to the {@link TryCatchFinally#doCatch(Throwable)} method
 * of the {@link TryCatchFinally} that owns the asynchronous task that failed.
 * See {@link TryCatchFinally} for more info on the error handling.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For promises that don't need a value and just used to ensure correct ordering
 * of asynchronous operations the common pattern to use {@link Void} as a
 * generic type.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @param <V>
 *            The result type returned by this Promise's get method. Use
 *            {@link Void} to represent Promise that indicates completion of
 *            operation that doesn't return a value.
