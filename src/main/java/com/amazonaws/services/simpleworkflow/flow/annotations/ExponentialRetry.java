 * <p>
 * To allow retries for an individual activity, place the annotation on the desired 
 * activity method in the corresponding @Activities <b>interface</b>.  Since a new
 * activity instance is started per retry, any timeouts configured on the 
 * {@literal @}ActivityRegistrationOptions apply to each individual retry of the activity.

 * To allow retries for an entire workflow, place the annotation on the override
 * of the workflow's @Execute method in the @Workflow's <b>implementation</b>
 * (rather than on the interface).  Since the same workflow instance is reused 
 * for each retry, any timeouts configured on the @WorkflowRegistrationOptions 
 * apply to the total time of the workflow over all retries.
